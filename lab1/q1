logging information that is received from a variety of sources: Kernel log messages, via kmsg

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2)systemd-udevd

The behavior of the daemon can be configured using udev. conf(5), its command line options, environment variables, and on the kernel command line, or changed dynamically with udevadm control

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3)irqbalance

irqbalance is a Linux daemon that distributes interrupts over among the processors and cores in your computer system. The design goal of irqbalance is to do find a balance between power savings and optimal performance. ... This allows a given set of CPU's to not be bothered by any interrupt service load

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4)systemd-logind

Keeping track of users and sessions, their processes and their idle state. This is implemented by allocating a systemd slice unit for each user below user.slice, and a scope unit below it for each concurrent session of a user.

5)upowerd - UPower Daemon  

upowerd provides the org.freedesktop.UPower service on the system message bus. Users or administrators should never need to start this daemon as it will be automatically started by dbus-daemon(1) whenever an application calls into the org.freedesktop.UPower service.

9)boltd - thunderbolt device managing system daemon

boltd is the thunderbolt device manager daemon. Its goal is to enable the secure and convenient use of thunderbolt devices by using the security features of modern thunderbolt controllers. It provides the org.freedesktop.bolt name on the system bus. boltd is autostarted via systemd/udev if a thunderbolt device is connected.

10)initd

init.d is deamon which is the first process of the Linux system. Then other processes, services, daemons, and threats are started by init. So init.d is a configuration database for the init process.
